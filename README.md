## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I'm still learning and practicing JavaScript, and I feel proud of how this project turned out. I forgo using a regular expression to verify the email and decided to use a regular If statement. 

### Continued development

I tried using an Else If to verify that the email is written correctly and that the input isn't empty, but it wasn't working as expected. I will return to this challenge at some point to try and make it work.

### Useful resources

- [Form validation using javascript](https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/form-validation-using-javascript-34je) - I wouldn't have been able to do the JS for this challenge without this article.
